## General Information

In this project, we will analyze the happiness levels across various countries in the North America and ANZ region by leveraging socio-demographic data available in the World Happiness Report. Our analysis will be conducted using the `plm()` function in R, which allows for panel data analysis. Through this analysis, we aim to gain insights into the socio-economic dynamics and their impact on the well-being of individuals in North America and ANZ. This project, as part of Learn by Building (LBB), focuses on applying knowledge related to exploring panel data using the `plm()` function in R. The sequence of the process include:
